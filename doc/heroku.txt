USAGE                                           *heroku* *:Heroku* *:Hk*

:Heroku [args]          Run hk or heroku with the given [args] using
                        |:Dispatch| (or |:make| if unavailable).  If both
                        commands are installed, hk is used for known hk
                        commands and plugins, and heroku is used for
                        everything else.  Tab completion is for hk only.

:Heroku run [args]      Identical to :Heroku above, but uses |:Start| (or |:!|
:Heroku console [args]  if unavailable).

When editing a file in a Git repository, every Heroku remote from that
repository is camel cased and turned into a :Heroku command wrapper that
passes the appropriate app argument.  For example, if you have a remote named
staging pointed at git@heroku.com:myapp-staging.git, calling :Staging restart
is equivalent to calling :Heroku restart -a myapp-staging.

Also included is basic projectionist.vim support for legacy Ruby CLI plugins.
